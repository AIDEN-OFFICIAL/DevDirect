## üß† Ideas
**[**
- **Interviewer Profile Setup**  
  When an interviewer creates their profile, they'll specify their domain and expertise levels in different technologies.

- **Student Questionnaire**  
  After a student books an interview slot, they'll fill out a questionnaire detailing their experience, desired topics, and any specific questions they have.

- **Interview Preparation**  
  The interviewer receives the student's questionnaire and uses it to prepare for the session.

## üåê Application Pages

### 1. Homepage

**Goal:**  
The goal of the homepage is to clearly and quickly explain what DevDirect is and guide both students and interviewers to their respective journeys. The design should be clean, professional, and easy to navigate.

This is a great approach. Breaking the project down into individual pages and focusing on one at a time will make the process much more manageable.  
Let's start with the very beginning: the Homepage. This is the first page a user sees, and its design sets the entire tone for the platform.

**Sections:**

   - Logo (Left)

3. **Features Section**  
   - **Headings**: ("Why DevDirect?" or "How It Works.")  
   - **Layout**: three-section vertical layout (3 cols)

     - Sec2: Flexible & Convenient (Icon: calendar/clock. Title: *Book when it works for you*. Desc: "Find and book mock interviews that fit your schedule. With a wide range of professionals available, you can practice on your own time, from anywhere.")

     - Sec4: Specialized Courses (Icon: book/diploma. Desc: "Beyond mock interviews, access a library of specialized courses and content designed by our expert interviewers to fill any gaps in your knowledge.")  

4. **For Interviewers Section**

   - Sub-heading: "Your skills are in demand. Join our platform to share your knowledge and earn on your own terms."
